# FlashCards

## Abstract
In this project, I wrote a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line. The user can see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round. Through each iteration I used TDD to drive the implementation of my code.

## Working Application

## Setup
Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub).
Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:
`npm install`

Running `node index.js` from the root of the flashcards repo should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal:

Welcome to FlashCards! You are playing with 30 cards.
